  <h2>Cid Garlond</h2>

  <p>Cid Garlond is a non-player character from Final Fantasy XIV. He leads the Garlond Ironworks, a group of Garlean and Eorzean engineers working together to arm Eorzea's city-states with Garlemald's powerful technology: magitek. Before he defected to Eorzea, Cid achieved the rank of 'nan', or Chief Magitek Engineer, and was known as Cid nan Garlond.</p>

  <p>Cid Garlond belongs to the long line of characters in the Final Fantasy series called Cid, usually an older man associated with engineering or airships in some manner.</p>

  <p>Cid was born to Grand Minister of Industry Midas "Mid" nan Garlond and was regarded a prodigy in magitek engineering, much like his father. He catapulted into fame and popularity for his advancements in the field. When Mid became enthralled with Project Meteor, Cid began to grow distant and was taken in by his father's friend, Gaius van Baelsar, who raised him to adulthood as if Cid was his own son. Under Gaius's guardianship Cid earned the ire and jealousy of Nero tol Scaeva after being appointed a Minister of Industry.</p>

  <p>Cid was an important character on the Seventh Umbral Era storyline, working closely with the Grand Companies to investigate the recent Garlean activity and its relationship with Meteor, as he was directly responsible for the recent development of Garlean magitek.</p>
